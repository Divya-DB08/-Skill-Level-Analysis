# Skill-Level-Analysis




This image presents a dashboard for analyzing the skill level and attendance patterns of job trainees, likely at a basic to intermediate level. It's designed to provide a quick overview of key performance indicators and demographic breakdowns. Let's break down the components:

Key Metrics:

Total Enrolled (38): The total number of trainees in the program. This provides the baseline for understanding the scope of the data.
Present (33) and Absent (5): A simple count of present and absent trainees. This is crucial for tracking attendance and identifying potential issues with trainee engagement or retention.
Attendance Rate (86.84%): The average attendance rate, calculated from the present and absent numbers. This provides a high-level view of overall attendance.
Breakdowns and Filters:

Model Filter: Allows filtering of data by different "Models" (categories or batches of trainees). This enables comparison of performance across different groups.
Senior Manager Filter: Enables analysis of trainees based on the Senior Manager responsible for them. This allows for the evaluation of training effectiveness across different managers.
Team Filter: Provides the ability to analyze data by specific teams, offering insights into team dynamics and performance.
Job Level Filter: Allows filtering based on the job level of the trainees (e.g., Analyst, Executive, Senior Analyst, Senior Executive). This helps in understanding skill and attendance patterns at different levels.
Visualizations:

Team-wise Attendance (Bar Chart): Compares the number of present and absent trainees across different teams. This allows for easy identification of teams with high or low attendance rates.
Manager-wise Attendance (Bar Chart): Shows the number of trainees under each manager, along with their attendance status. This helps in evaluating manager-wise performance in terms of trainee engagement and attendance.
Gender-wise Distribution (Pie Chart): Displays the proportion of male and female trainees. This provides insights into the gender balance of the trainee program.
Level-wise Distribution (Treemap): Shows the distribution of trainees across different job levels. The size of the boxes represents the number of trainees at each level, providing a visual representation of the distribution.
Analysis Potential:

This dashboard allows for the following types of analysis:

Identifying Trainees at Risk: By examining attendance patterns, particularly in conjunction with manager and team filters, trainees with consistently low attendance can be identified for intervention and support.
Evaluating Training Effectiveness: Comparing attendance and potentially other performance metrics across different models, senior managers, and teams can provide insights into the effectiveness of different training approaches.
Understanding Skill Gaps: Analyzing the distribution of trainees across job levels can highlight potential skill gaps and inform the design of targeted training programs.
Promoting Diversity and Inclusion: The gender-wise distribution data can be used to monitor and promote gender balance in the trainee program.
Overall, this dashboard provides a valuable tool for analyzing trainee data, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring the success of basic and intermediate-level job trainees. The combination of key metrics, filters, and visualizations allows for a comprehensive understanding of trainee performance and demographics.
